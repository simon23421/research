You don't know exactly where to start, what strategies\n","[00:10.120 --> 00:14.200]  that you should be using, and you're probably feeling very overwhelmed. With how popular\n","[00:14.200 --> 00:18.640]  dropshipping is becoming, it is now a high-level skill that can be making you some serious\n","[00:18.640 --> 00:23.920]  money online. So, you want to know exactly how to start with no confusion left on the\n","[00:23.920 --> 00:24.920]  table.\n","[00:24.920 --> 00:28.480]  That's why today I'm going to be breaking down a beginner-friendly, step-by-step tutorial\n","[00:28.480 --> 00:33.420]  on how you can get started with dropshipping in 2023. So, by the end of this video, you\n","[00:33.420 --> 00:37.160]  feel fully confident in the ability to know exactly how to get started. And I'm not going\n","[00:37.160 --> 00:40.920]  to just leave it at that. Once this video reaches 1500 likes, I'm going to give you\n","[00:40.920 --> 00:42.600]  a product list of the top 10.\n","[00:42.600 --> 00:46.880]  I'll come over here to heading 1. Something like this. Protect yourself and your belongings\n","[00:46.880 --> 00:50.640]  everywhere you go. This is probably one of the main reasons that somebody would buy this\n","[00:50.640 --> 00:54.260]  product in the first place. And then after highlighting this main problem, now I'm going\n","[00:54.260 --> 00:58.000]  to go ahead and introduce the solution. And as you can see, that's exactly what I did\n","[00:58.000 --> 01:02.080]  right here. So, I went from protecting yourself and your belongings everywhere you go.\n","[01:02.080 --> 01:05.720]  Our theft backpacks and bags are becoming a vital piece of gear for everyone who carries\n","[01:05.720 --> 01:10.860]  their gear to school, work, around town, or when they travel, hitting all different types\n","[01:10.860 --> 01:15.360]  of audiences of people. This must-have wearable backpack is designed to keep your gear safe\n","[01:15.360 --> 01:19.660]  and you looking stylish, which is again, the main problem that people are going to have\n","[01:19.660 --> 01:23.260]  now with the immediate solution. Then after this, I'm just going to go ahead and add an\n","[01:23.260 --> 01:27.660]  interactive gift or image that's highlighting winning and trending products that you need\n","[01:27.660 --> 01:31.520]  to be selling right now. So, if you want full access to this product list, smash that\n","[01:31.520 --> 01:35.380]  like button down below, subscribe to this channel so I can release all the links to\n","[01:35.380 --> 01:39.260]  these products and help you get started in the right direction. So, without further ado,\n","[01:39.260 --> 01:44.280]  let's go ahead and jump right into it. What's going on? My name is AC Hampton. I'm an eight-figure\n","[01:44.280 --> 01:49.220]  marketer who has generated sales just like this, all from starting and branding dropshipping\n","[01:49.220 --> 01:54.180]  stores. While doing this, I also get to teach students from all over the world how to generate\n","[01:54.180 --> 01:58.940]  results with their own dropshipping stores and make money online. If you want to experience\n","[01:58.940 --> 02:02.980]  what being a student in my one-on-one mentorship feels like, each week I get to hand out a\n","[02:02.980 --> 02:07.180]  free consulting call to one lucky winner. So, if you want the opportunity of getting\n","[02:07.180 --> 02:10.620]  on this call and go over anything you may be struggling with and answering all of your\n","[02:10.620 --> 02:14.700]  questions along the way, all you have to do is smash that like button down below and in\n","[02:14.700 --> 02:18.580]  the comment section, comment the word dropship with your biggest takeaway from this video.\n","[02:18.580 --> 02:22.640]  Now, there's a ton of information out there in regards to starting your own dropshipping\n","[02:22.640 --> 02:27.960]  business, but let's take it all the way from the top. And the top is creating your online\n","[02:27.960 --> 02:32.440]  store. You cannot run an online business without a storefront. So, let's hop into how you're\n","[02:32.440 --> 02:36.040]  going to get it and how you're going to build it. So, we're heading over here to Shopify\n","[02:36.040 --> 02:40.480]  and as you can see, you can start a seven-day free trial, no credit card required, and your\n","[02:40.480 --> 02:45.060]  next three months only costing you $1 by clicking on the link down in my description. Now, this\n","[02:45.060 --> 02:49.600]  is great for you, especially while just starting off because you're immediately insane. And\n","[02:49.600 --> 02:54.240]  how I do that is as simple as this. So, I'll just come over here to insert image, upload\n","[02:54.240 --> 02:58.240]  file, and then go ahead and select on the first image that I chose. And now you see\n","[02:58.240 --> 03:02.960]  I have the problem, the solution, and the image that's highlighting all of that together.\n","[03:02.960 --> 03:07.080]  And then I'll continue that same type of format for about four to five more features and benefits\n","[03:07.080 --> 03:16.560]  and then we'll have our product page built. So, let me go ahead and do that real quick.\n","[03:16.560 --> 03:19.400]  And then when you're finished, it should look something just like this. So, you see\n","[03:19.400 --> 03:25.680]  how it's the main feature, the main benefit image, main feature, main benefit image, all\n","[03:25.680 --> 03:29.200]  the way down. And then whenever you're done, you just go ahead and click on save. Now that\n","[03:29.200 --> 03:32.300]  you have all this saved, you can actually cutting down on the expenses that starting\n","[03:32.300 --> 03:36.560]  your online store can come with. So, make sure to go ahead and check that out. Now,\n","[03:36.560 --> 03:40.240]  Shopify is a platform that your website will be built on and where you'll have the actual\n","[03:40.240 --> 03:44.500]  storefront for the product or products that you're selling. Now, there are other e-commerce\n","[03:44.500 --> 03:49.180]  platforms out there that you may have heard of, but Shopify is by far the most reliable\n","[03:49.180 --> 03:53.340]  and beginner friendly. So, I highly suggest that you start there. So, once you're on this\n","[03:53.340 --> 03:56.340]  page, you're going to come down over here to enter your email address and just go ahead\n","[03:56.340 --> 04:00.060]  and enter that. And then after entering your email, you're going to go to start free trial.\n","[04:00.060 --> 04:03.780]  Then this screen will come up. You'll just do I'm just starting. Click on an online store\n","[04:03.780 --> 04:07.740]  and click next. You can go ahead and skip this part right here. And then this is going\n","[04:07.740 --> 04:11.540]  to be the next screen that you see. And then here you can go ahead and just name your store.\n","[04:11.540 --> 04:15.300]  And like I said, I would not spend a lot of time preview it by clicking on this preview\n","[04:15.300 --> 04:19.380]  button right here. And this gives you a rundown of what your product page basically looks\n","[04:19.380 --> 04:24.380]  like out the gate. Now, one thing I definitely advise doing is having a compare price on\n","[04:24.380 --> 04:28.900]  your product page. So, you see how this just says $94.99. We want to make sure that they're\n","[04:28.900 --> 04:32.780]  actually getting a good sale when they're buying the product. And what I like doing\n","[04:32.780 --> 04:39.260]  is at least a 50% off deal. So, I'll take this $94.99 and I'll multiply it by two. And\n","[04:39.260 --> 04:44.220]  that's going to be $189.98. So, once I'm back on the Shopify page, I'm just going to go\n","[04:44.220 --> 04:47.700]  ahead and highlight this variant and then open bulk editor. And that's where I'm going\n","[04:47.700 --> 04:53.500]  to go ahead and put that compare price of $189.98 and then go ahead and click on save.\n","[04:53.500 --> 04:57.180]  And now you can see you have your selling price and your compare price right here. Now,\n","[04:57.180 --> 05:00.920]  there are going to be some on this. You don't want to overthink this. Just keep this very\n","[05:00.920 --> 05:05.840]  simple and very general. Wherever your business is located, you'll go ahead and click on next.\n","[05:06.840 --> 05:14.200]  Now, we just opened up a new store with a free trial and you're already 10 steps ahead\n","[05:14.200 --> 05:18.640]  of where you previously were at the beginning of this video because your store is officially\n","[05:18.640 --> 05:22.840]  open. Now, let's go ahead and get into the build and everything that you'll need to make\n","[05:22.840 --> 05:27.580]  sure that when customers are coming to your store, they always leave with purchasing something\n","[05:27.580 --> 05:31.500]  and putting more money back into your pocket. Now, the first thing that you want to do is\n","[05:31.500 --> 05:36.420]  head over to your Shopify App Store and search for an app called Autodesk. And it's as simple\n","[05:36.420 --> 05:40.660]  as this. You come over here to apps and you type in Autodesk and click on enter. And this\n","[05:40.660 --> 05:43.720]  is what the Shopify App Store looks like. Some apps that you're going to want to make\n","[05:43.720 --> 05:47.820]  sure that you have on your store that can help you increase your average order value,\n","[05:47.820 --> 05:51.940]  which means more money back in your pocket and also some apps that will make your customers\n","[05:51.940 --> 05:56.560]  purchase from you. I broke all those apps down and how to set them up in this video\n","[05:56.560 --> 06:00.180]  right here. So, make sure you go ahead and check that out after you finish watching this\n","[06:00.180 --> 06:04.420]  video. So, now you have your product page set up, which is where you will be directing\n","[06:04.420 --> 06:08.660]  traffic to from your ads. And although it's very important, it's not going to do anything\n","[06:08.660 --> 06:13.260]  for you if the rest of your store is completely empty. This means it's time for you to set\n","[06:13.260 --> 06:16.980]  up your actual storefront and homepage so that if customers actually decide to browse\n","[06:16.980 --> 06:21.180]  around on your site, they don't run into blank pages or links that don't work, which can\n","[06:21.180 --> 06:25.400]  be detrimental to whether you're getting sales or not. So, as of right now, if we do click\n","[06:25.400 --> 06:29.260]  on the homepage of our store and it's going to be this one right here that says Autodesk\n","[06:29.260 --> 06:33.140]  all-in-one dropshipping. And Autodesk is literally an all-in-one dropshipping tool\n","[06:33.140 --> 06:37.880]  that you need on your online store. This app will allow you to connect your store to different\n","[06:37.880 --> 06:42.000]  suppliers that you may be wanting to use to help sell your product. It will let you browse\n","[06:42.000 --> 06:45.260]  through potential products that you could be selling. And it even has the capability\n","[06:45.260 --> 06:49.380]  to fulfill the orders you're getting on your store automatically and send out tracking\n","[06:49.380 --> 06:53.780]  information directly to your customer. I mean, Autodesk is going to make running your dropshipping\n","[06:53.780 --> 06:59.700]  business as a beginner, as seamless as possible. I wish, I mean, I wish they had apps like\n","[06:59.700 --> 07:03.860]  that when I first started my dropshipping journey because automation is everything.\n","[07:03.860 --> 07:07.300]  And that's exactly what this app will give to you. I'm going to go ahead and add this\n","[07:07.300 --> 07:10.700]  app into my store. And it's just as simple as clicking add. You can see right now, this\n","[07:10.700 --> 07:15.860]  is completely empty. So, with that being said, we need to choose a theme and start building.\n","[07:15.860 --> 07:19.540]  A theme is what allows you to control the layout of your store and how it looks and\n","[07:19.540 --> 07:23.580]  Shopify provides multiple free options that you can choose from. And if you want to see\n","[07:23.580 --> 07:26.940]  those options, all you have to do is come over here to online store, come down here\n","[07:26.940 --> 07:31.100]  to theme library, go to explore free themes, and you can see all the ones that Shopify\n","[07:31.100 --> 07:35.900]  offers right away. Now, although there are paid or coded themes that you could use, I\n","[07:35.900 --> 07:39.900]  think the free option is the best to use as a beginner as it won't slow the speed of your\n","[07:39.900 --> 07:45.860]  store down and they're very beginner friendly. So, let's take this refresh theme as an example.\n","[07:45.860 --> 07:49.220]  We'll go ahead and click on that and then add to theme library. And then once that's\n","[07:49.220 --> 07:52.640]  happening, it will say right here, installing theme. And then you want to go ahead and publish\n","[07:52.700 --> 07:57.280]  that to your app and then install app. Now that we have Autodesk downloaded, the next\n","[07:57.280 --> 08:00.760]  thing we need to do is connect this with our Shopify store. So, this is going to be the\n","[08:00.760 --> 08:04.320]  first screen you'll see. You'll go to add store, come to this plus sign where it says\n","[08:04.320 --> 08:08.720]  add store at the bottom, click on Shopify store and click continue. You come back over\n","[08:08.720 --> 08:12.960]  here to your Shopify, highlight the actual HTML and then go ahead and add that to your\n","[08:12.960 --> 08:16.180]  store. And it's as simple as that. And if you want to make sure it's connected, you\n","[08:16.180 --> 08:20.260]  should see your actual Shopify store right here at the top left corner. Now, before we\n","[08:20.260 --> 08:24.340]  head into the overall build of your store and making sure that you have all the necessary\n","[08:24.340 --> 08:28.780]  instructions to get your store off the ground and running, my team and I do provide hands\n","[08:28.780 --> 08:33.040]  on one on one guidance to help you directly with learning strategies of running your online\n","[08:33.040 --> 08:36.880]  store that can help you make money not just for sure. So, you'll come over here to actions\n","[08:36.880 --> 08:40.400]  and then go ahead and click on publish and then click on publish again. And now you'll\n","[08:40.400 --> 08:43.900]  see that refresh theme is the actual theme published to your store. We'll go ahead and\n","[08:43.900 --> 08:48.240]  scroll over here to customize right next to the theme and it will take us into the homepage\n","[08:48.240 --> 08:52.860]  of our store that we're able to customize it exactly how we want. When building your\n","[08:52.860 --> 08:57.540]  store homepage, you always want to make sure that it's as open and inviting as possible\n","[08:57.540 --> 09:02.580]  and possibly aiming towards whatever holiday or season is currently happening. Like right\n","[09:02.580 --> 09:06.760]  now, since it's the winter time, maybe I could have people outside playing in the snow or\n","[09:06.760 --> 09:10.360]  hanging around their family since that's what people are doing in the family time and making\n","[09:10.360 --> 09:14.500]  my store completely around them. And I typically put this in my home image with the colors\n","[09:14.500 --> 09:18.520]  of my store matching whatever season is currently happening. Now, like I said, you want to keep\n","[09:18.520 --> 09:24.360]  these images for short term but for a lifetime. So, if you're ready to take action and start\n","[09:24.360 --> 09:27.920]  learning with my team and I by your side, make sure you head over to my Instagram at\n","[09:27.920 --> 09:32.620]  AC underscore Hampton DM me the word mentorship or apply with the link down in my description\n","[09:32.620 --> 09:36.780]  so I can reach out and help you get started. Now that we have Autodesk connected, you're\n","[09:36.780 --> 09:41.240]  going to want to start off with importing your first product to your store. But in order\n","[09:41.240 --> 09:45.160]  to import a product, you have to know what you're looking for in a product that you should\n","[09:45.160 --> 09:50.440]  be selling. It is not smart to come into dropshipping thinking you can just sell any and everything\n","[09:50.440 --> 09:55.260]  because that's going to cause you to spend a lot of time and money into the wrong direction.\n","[09:55.260 --> 09:58.400]  When you're scrolling through your products on Autodesk and looking for one that you can\n","[09:58.400 --> 10:01.960]  be selling, you want to make sure that the product is hitting some very important key\n","[10:01.960 --> 10:05.760]  factor. And this is going to be a key thing that you do, especially when starting your\n","[10:05.760 --> 10:10.280]  dropshipping store, as you always should start off with a general store. A general store\n","[10:10.320 --> 10:14.440]  is a store that allows you to sell different products that may fall under different niches\n","[10:14.440 --> 10:18.580]  all under one specific store. And I always suggest starting off with a general store\n","[10:18.580 --> 10:22.400]  because this is what's going to allow you to test out different products without having\n","[10:22.400 --> 10:26.720]  to change everything on your store every time just one of these things don't work out for\n","[10:26.720 --> 10:30.620]  you. This then saves you time and money that you would be spending opening and building\n","[10:30.620 --> 10:35.320]  new Shopify stores every time you just want to test out a different product. This is exactly\n","[10:35.320 --> 10:39.640]  why you want to keep your homepage as open and generic as possible, more so pertaining\n","[10:40.000 --> 10:43.920]  to the season or holiday that is happening as opposed to putting a product on display\n","[10:43.920 --> 10:47.640]  that might not be the same product that you're selling next month. And one of my favorite\n","[10:47.640 --> 10:51.840]  ways of finding these images that I use, with number one being that it solves some sort\n","[10:51.840 --> 10:56.760]  of problem. Now, this is because a product that solves a problem is likely to sell for\n","[10:56.760 --> 11:02.100]  a longer period of time. Secondly, that it can be sold for $25 or more. By doing a quick\n","[11:02.100 --> 11:06.020]  search for the product on Google, you can see on average what your competition is selling\n","[11:06.020 --> 11:10.180]  the product for. And if it's being sold for less than $25, you'll find that you're spending\n","[11:10.180 --> 11:13.980]  more money in ads than what you're actually making from selling it. So let's take this\n","[11:13.980 --> 11:18.380]  product right here as an example. So this is the anti-theft travel backpack. And you\n","[11:18.380 --> 11:21.980]  can see when I'm on Google, and I'm actually searching for this, you can see that most\n","[11:21.980 --> 11:26.760]  of these products are over $25, if not all of them. So this is telling me right away\n","[11:26.760 --> 11:32.300]  that this is being sold for $25 or more across the entire market. And lastly, you want to\n","[11:32.300 --> 11:36.420]  make sure that there is demand in the market for the product. I know our non-copyrighted\n","[11:36.420 --> 11:41.100]  is using one of my favorite free websites called Pexels. So you just come over here\n","[11:41.100 --> 11:44.700]  and type in Pexels. And it's going to be this one right here. So because it's the winter\n","[11:44.700 --> 11:48.900]  time, I want to keep it generic. I'll probably just type in winter family. And I mean, this\n","[11:48.900 --> 11:52.220]  is a pretty good image right here. And I can just go ahead and click on download. And now\n","[11:52.220 --> 11:55.900]  I can come back to my store and add that image right away. And I'm going to go ahead and\n","[11:55.900 --> 12:03.980]  upload that real quick. And this is what it looks like when you upload your first image,\n","[12:03.980 --> 12:10.220]  I'm going to go ahead and upload the rest of this product description. And just like\n","[12:10.220 --> 12:14.420]  that, in less than five minutes, we have our homepage set up and ready to go. And you can\n","[12:14.420 --> 12:18.560]  see I have winter sale at the top around the season that's happening like that you're selling\n","[12:18.560 --> 12:22.520]  and you can do this by heading over to Google trends and searching a keyword surrounding\n","[12:22.520 --> 12:27.680]  your product and seeing if it's on an upward or a downward trend. And we take that exact\n","[12:27.680 --> 12:31.480]  product, put it in Google Trends, you can see that this is slowly on the upward trend.\n","[12:31.480 --> 12:34.940]  And that's exactly what you want to be seeing across any product that you're selling. Think\n","[12:34.940 --> 12:38.240]  about it, every business is based off of supply and demand. And when you see something like\n","[12:38.240 --> 12:42.240]  this being in constant demand, it shows that we should have the supply to back up the product.\n","[12:42.240 --> 12:46.280]  And that's exactly what we do with dropshipping. So now in order to start looking for the products\n","[12:46.280 --> 12:49.320]  that you're going to want to start selling, you're going to want to go to auto DS, you're\n","[12:49.320 --> 12:52.960]  going to want to click on these dots up here and then go over to product research. From\n","[12:52.960 --> 12:56.160]  there, you're given a couple of different options for what type of products that you\n","[12:56.160 --> 13:01.000]  want to look at from popular products to new products to US supplied products. I have my\n","[13:01.000 --> 13:06.560]  background non copyrighted image all the way down to my mission statement, some collections,\n","[13:06.560 --> 13:12.740]  my main feature product, even a email collector. But at this point, you're missing one thing,\n","[13:12.740 --> 13:17.720]  which is your logo. Since we have a general store with a general store name, you got that\n","[13:17.720 --> 13:21.840]  right, we're going to make our logo kind of general. And there's no reason to spend\n","[13:21.840 --> 13:26.040]  hundreds of dollars on getting a logo made when you can head over to Canva and make one\n","[13:26.040 --> 13:30.000]  in less than five minutes with the templates that we have waiting for you. So just come\n","[13:30.000 --> 13:34.120]  over here, type in canva.com and then you want to come over here to the search bar and\n","[13:34.120 --> 13:37.920]  type in logo. And you're going to see all the different logos that you can work with.\n","[13:37.920 --> 13:42.080]  I like to just choose a logo that sticks out to me and then just throw my brand name in\n","[13:42.080 --> 13:45.640]  there and then choose the colors that I want my store to be. You can just continue to scroll\n","[13:45.640 --> 13:49.600]  through each section until you find a product that meets the criteria that we just talked\n","[13:49.600 --> 13:53.580]  about. And if you want to give Autodesk a try with the 30 day free trial, make sure\n","[13:53.580 --> 13:56.780]  you go ahead and click on the link down in my description to go ahead and try it out.\n","[13:56.780 --> 13:59.980]  So like I said, the first step is just going through any of these and just scrolling to\n","[13:59.980 --> 14:03.760]  find any products that we could possibly work with. So let's say this product right here\n","[14:03.760 --> 14:07.320]  is what I want to add to my store. It's as simple as this. I'm gonna come over here to\n","[14:07.320 --> 14:11.220]  import product and then it's going to say item is being added to drafts. Click here\n","[14:11.220 --> 14:14.920]  to view and then you'll see your product right here in the drafts before actually uploading\n","[14:14.920 --> 14:19.160]  this to your store. Now I typically draft a product just like this so I'm able to work\n","[14:19.160 --> 14:22.940]  on the product description directly from the screen and make sure everything is good to\n","[14:22.940 --> 14:26.800]  go before publishing for the customers to see. And inside this draft section right here\n","[14:26.800 --> 14:30.840]  I always suggest that when you're building your logo, you just choose white, black and\n","[14:30.840 --> 14:35.560]  one accent color so it's not too busy and distracting from your store. You want a nice\n","[14:35.560 --> 14:39.680]  clean and professional feel and that's exactly what that's going to do for you. So I could\n","[14:39.680 --> 14:43.480]  choose this one right here for example. Now I can go ahead and build this logo out real\n","[14:43.480 --> 14:51.440]  quickly. And I mean it's literally this easy. Once I'm done with that I'm gonna come over\n","[14:51.440 --> 14:55.000]  here to share and then I'm gonna go ahead and download it. And you do want to download\n","[14:55.000 --> 14:58.980]  it with the transparent background so you're able to throw it directly onto your store.\n","[14:58.980 --> 15:02.820]  Let's head back over to Shopify so I can show you exactly what your next steps are. So now\n","[15:02.820 --> 15:06.520]  that we're back on Shopify we're gonna come over here to our header and you'll see it\n","[15:06.520 --> 15:10.560]  says default logo. This is where you want to go ahead and change. Auto DS you can see\n","[15:10.560 --> 15:14.560]  every product that you've imported to your store but haven't quite yet published. That's\n","[15:14.560 --> 15:17.760]  where I like to work on naming the products, selecting the variants that I'm going to be\n","[15:17.760 --> 15:21.880]  selling and choosing the price that I'm going to be selling it at. And how you actually\n","[15:21.880 --> 15:24.440]  edit the product is you're gonna click on this little arrow and it's gonna show you\n","[15:24.440 --> 15:28.840]  the product, the description, the variants, the images and more. Now I always suggest\n","[15:28.840 --> 15:33.160]  giving your product a catchy name and then describing what it is. So I'm just gonna name\n","[15:33.160 --> 15:39.200]  this anti-theft waterproof travel backpack. So you see I didn't just name this the product\n","[15:39.200 --> 15:44.140]  itself but I named it anti-theft waterproof travel backpack to go ahead and customize\n","[15:44.140 --> 15:47.960]  it just a little bit to stand out from my competition. Now by doing this you're giving\n","[15:47.960 --> 15:52.160]  your customers something to remember you by so that they can always come back and find\n","[15:52.160 --> 15:56.200]  you or you want to go ahead and select an image, upload, and then this is where your\n","[15:56.200 --> 15:59.960]  logo is going to be imported. And that's it. It's as simple as that. And you just want\n","[15:59.960 --> 16:03.360]  to go ahead and click on save. Now that we have the logo in let's go ahead and check\n","[16:03.360 --> 16:06.640]  it out by viewing the store. And if you want to view the store you just go ahead and click\n","[16:06.640 --> 16:10.920]  on these three dots and click on view. Hey and look at what we got going on man. Look\n","[16:10.920 --> 16:16.200]  at what we got going on. Not looking too shabby. Especially for only a couple minutes. Now\n","[16:16.200 --> 16:20.000]  that you have your homepage and your product page set up it's time for you to get into\n","[16:20.000 --> 16:23.760]  running your ads but in order for you to do that you need to make sure that you have a\n","[16:23.760 --> 16:28.300]  Facebook business manager and ads manager created so you're able to connect it to your\n","[16:28.300 --> 16:32.460]  Shopify account. Your Facebook business manager and ads manager is what's going to allow you\n","[16:32.460 --> 16:36.980]  to set up your first campaign and start selling your product so you have to make sure that\n","[16:36.980 --> 16:40.980]  you have these open. The next time that they see your advertisement they're more inclined\n","[16:40.980 --> 16:45.220]  to head into your store because they know it's you. And as I said you're also going\n","[16:45.220 --> 16:49.580]  to change the pricing of your product on this exact same page. And whenever you're pricing\n","[16:49.580 --> 16:53.260]  your product you always want to make sure that you're selling it for at least 2.5x your\n","[16:53.260 --> 16:57.280]  cost of goods. What this means is that if you're buying something for $10 with shipping\n","[16:57.280 --> 17:01.320]  included from AliExpress or whatever supplier that you decide to use you want to make sure\n","[17:01.320 --> 17:06.880]  that you're selling it for at least 2.5x which would come out to $25. By standing by this\n","[17:06.880 --> 17:10.760]  rule you're going to help in keeping your profit margins on the higher side so that\n","[17:10.760 --> 17:14.280]  you can continue to keep profiting with your online store. So let me head over here to\n","[17:14.280 --> 17:18.480]  AliExpress for example and I'm literally just going to go ahead and type the product in.\n","[17:18.480 --> 17:23.840]  And let's take this variant right here for example. I see that this product is $37 and\n","[17:23.840 --> 17:27.320]  to do this you just come over to Google and type in business Facebook. And this is one\n","[17:27.320 --> 17:30.360]  of the first screens that you're going to see. So you just go ahead and create a meta\n","[17:30.360 --> 17:34.460]  business account by just typing in your business account name. And this should just be basically\n","[17:34.460 --> 17:38.480]  what your store name is called. Enter your information and then go ahead and click on\n","[17:38.480 --> 17:43.480]  create. Once you have all that connected you're going to want to head back over to Shopify\n","[17:43.480 --> 17:47.920]  where you'll now be connecting your Shopify account to the business manager and ads manager\n","[17:47.920 --> 17:52.360]  that you just created. You have to connect these two things to your Shopify account in\n","[17:52.360 --> 17:57.120]  order to run your ads and have data transferred over to your Shopify account so make sure\n","[17:57.120 --> 18:01.380]  that you do that. But in order to get it connected you're going to head back over here to Shopify\n","[18:01.380 --> 18:06.520]  like I mentioned. You're going to come over here to online store. Come over here to preferences\n","[18:06.520 --> 18:10.760]  and then you'll go ahead and click on $0.74. So if I take out my handy dandy calculator\n","[18:10.760 --> 18:20.200]  come over here and type in $37.74 times by 2.5. I see that this comes out to $94.35.\n","[18:20.200 --> 18:23.880]  So whenever I come over here to Autodesk now I need to change the pricing around that.\n","[18:23.880 --> 18:27.760]  So I'll just come over here to edit and you see where it says sell price right here. I'm\n","[18:27.760 --> 18:33.720]  just going to change this to $94.99. And now out the gate I'm getting the right profitability\n","[18:33.720 --> 18:37.040]  with this product. Now after that you want to make sure that you're actually choosing\n","[18:37.040 --> 18:41.380]  the variants that you want to sell. So for this example right here there is only one\n","[18:41.380 --> 18:45.500]  variant which is dark gray but if there were multiple different colors you want to choose\n","[18:45.500 --> 18:48.400]  the ones that you actually want to be selling with. And those variants that you decide to\n","[18:48.400 --> 18:52.560]  sell are based off of what your supplier can actually get. But for this start setup\n","[18:52.560 --> 18:56.080]  and then right here you're just going to connect the same Facebook account that you just registered\n","[18:56.080 --> 18:59.680]  your business manager with. So you just go over here to connect account then you're going\n","[18:59.680 --> 19:03.400]  to go ahead and click on the business manager that you just created and click connect. Check\n","[19:03.400 --> 19:07.160]  out method you want to ignore all of this and just go to your Shopify online store and\n","[19:07.160 --> 19:11.300]  click save. With the data sharing part you're going to have it automatically selected on\n","[19:11.300 --> 19:14.920]  enhance but you want to go ahead and click on maximum and then go ahead and click on\n","[19:14.920 --> 19:18.360]  save. Then you just want to go ahead and connect with the same pixel that you just registered\n","[19:18.360 --> 19:23.040]  with your business manager. Terms of conditions click agree and then submit for review. And\n","[19:23.040 --> 19:27.160]  then once you get to that entire checklist of connecting your Shopify account to your\n","[19:27.160 --> 19:32.000]  Facebook business and as manager you're now ready to officially start running your ads.\n","[19:32.000 --> 19:36.320]  And I've broken down how to set up test and run your very first example like I said there's\n","[19:36.320 --> 19:40.760]  only one variant. So once you've named your product you change your price and you chose\n","[19:40.760 --> 19:44.420]  the variance that you want to be selling all that you have left to do is click import to\n","[19:44.420 --> 19:48.540]  your store and then that product is published and added directly into your store. So like\n","[19:48.540 --> 19:51.980]  I said once you're done you just go ahead and click on import and then once you're finished\n","[19:51.980 --> 19:56.420]  with that you'll see that it says one out of one finish and now that product is imported.\n","[19:56.420 --> 20:00.360]  And if you come back over here to your Shopify store and click on refresh and then come over\n","[20:00.360 --> 20:05.200]  here to products you should be seeing that product right on your store just like this\n","[20:05.200 --> 20:09.820]  which now at this point it's time to get to work. Now once you're on the screen you see\n","[20:09.820 --> 20:13.620]  your product is imported and you actually click on it this is what's going to bring\n","[20:13.620 --> 20:18.460]  you up the product description.

So when creating the product page\n","[22:56.120 --> 22:59.860]  for the product that you're selling you never just want to go off the top of the head with\n","[22:59.860 --> 23:04.220]  what you think would look good on this page you want to use the resources that are available\n","[23:04.220 --> 23:09.420]  to you so that you can build a strong and persuasive product page so what I typically\n","[23:09.420 --> 23:13.260]  like to do is head over to Google and search for my product so like I said I'll come over\n","[23:13.260 --> 23:17.100]  here to Google and type in anti-theft travel backpack and what I'm going to do is just\n","[23:17.100 --> 23:20.400]  open up a couple different people who are selling these products and there's two main\n","[23:20.400 --> 23:24.420]  things I'm trying to validate whenever I'm opening up these product pages and the first\n","[23:24.420 --> 23:29.020]  is making sure that they're getting legitimate traffic and that is actually legitimate competitor\n","[23:29.020 --> 23:34.020]  and secondly making sure that they are using a Shopify store we never want to be reinventing\n","[23:34.020 --> 23:38.200]  the wheel we want to allow whatever's working in the market to work for us which is a direct\n","[23:38.200 --> 23:41.900]  reflection of everything that's going into our product page and to validate step number\n","[23:41.900 --> 23:46.540]  one which is are they actually getting legitimate traffic or not is with using one of my favorite\n","[23:46.540 --> 23:50.180]  free Google Chrome extensions called similar web so you'll literally come over here to\n","[23:50.180 --> 23:54.060]  Google type in similar web you'll come to this right here you'll go ahead and click\n","[23:54.060 --> 23:57.820]  on get started and then download this Google Chrome extension and then when you pull it\n","[23:57.820 --> 24:02.380]  up it looks something like this it shows you the traffic of the store it shows you where\n","[24:02.380 --> 24:07.140]  they're advertising and their traffic sources so they even know if this is legitimate competitor\n","[24:07.140 --> 24:10.940]  that we should be basing ourselves off of we need to know if they're even getting traffic\n","[24:10.940 --> 24:15.220]  at all so if I click on similar web on these websites and it says something like this we\n","[24:15.220 --> 24:19.560]  currently lack sufficient data then I know that this is not a legitimate competitor so\n","[24:19.560 --> 24:23.020]  I just start going down the line and I see okay which ones are getting traffic and which\n","[24:23.020 --> 24:27.240]  ones are not okay this one's getting traffic all right this one's getting traffic this\n","[24:27.240 --> 24:32.300]  one's not so I exit this one this one is so I'll keep that this one's not so I'll get\n","[24:32.300 --> 24:35.900]  rid of that and now the second thing that we need to be figuring out is okay are they\n","[24:35.900 --> 24:40.660]  even a Shopify store because we want to be basing ourselves off of our exact competition\n","[24:40.660 --> 24:44.900]  and to figure that out we can also do it for absolutely free by downloading another one\n","[24:44.900 --> 24:48.800]  of my favorite Google Chrome extensions called Commerce Inspector so you'll come over here\n","[24:48.800 --> 24:52.820]  to Google you'll type in Commerce Inspector you'll click on that one right there and then\n","[24:52.820 --> 24:57.180]  just install the free Google Chrome extension and to know if it's an actual Shopify store\n","[24:57.180 --> 25:02.100]  or not you'll see that this little magnifying glass is going to highlight and once it highlights\n","[25:02.100 --> 25:05.740]  you can go ahead and click on it and you can see right away that this is a drop shipping\n","[25:05.740 --> 25:10.580]  store I can see when they added these products I can see their best selling products and\n","[25:10.580 --> 25:14.180]  I can even see the newest products that they're adding to their store so now I just found\n","[25:14.180 --> 25:18.220]  out that they're getting legitimate traffic and these people are Shopify stores and to\n","[25:18.220 --> 25:22.680]  take it one step even further I'll open up another tab head over to Amazon and search\n","[25:22.680 --> 25:28.900]  for my exact product type in anti-theft backpack click on the variant that we're selling and\n","[25:28.900 --> 25:33.660]  then from there I'll find someone who's selling the product filtered down by one star reviews\n","[25:33.660 --> 25:37.460]  so I can see what troubles people are actually having with this product and that means as\n","[25:37.460 --> 25:41.700]  simple as this scroll all the way down to the bottom and only filter by the one star\n","[25:41.700 --> 25:46.160]  reviews so with examples of other sellers and feedback from what customers are actually\n","[25:46.160 --> 25:50.320]  saying about the product in the reviews you're now able to have the right information that\n","[25:50.320 --> 25:54.900]  help you build a strong and persuading product page selling your product while limiting the\n","[25:54.900 --> 25:59.220]  customer's concerns and now you can use the non copyrighted images and gifts that you're\n","[25:59.220 --> 26:03.440]  seeing your competitors using on their website but it's best to mix and match from multiple\n","[26:03.440 --> 26:08.340]  websites as you never want to just copy someone's entire product page you're here to make your\n","[26:08.340 --> 26:12.980]  product page better by pointing out different features and benefits and to create a stronger\n","[26:12.980 --> 26:17.920]  sell surrounding your product but you can utilize some of their best images and gifts\n","[26:17.920 --> 26:21.320]  to help you do that let's go ahead and get into how to build your product description\n","[26:21.320 --> 26:26.040]  out because this plays a major role in how long customers will stay on your product page\n","[26:26.040 --> 26:30.520]  and the longer they stay the more likely they are to buy so whenever you're building your\n","[26:30.520 --> 26:36.200]  product page you do not I repeat do not want to have a ton of text or just images while\n","[26:36.200 --> 26:40.120]  trying to portray why customers should buy your product you need to have breaks with\n","[26:40.120 --> 26:44.640]  the customer's eyes with images and gifts so how you should be setting up is by having\n","[26:44.640 --> 26:48.400]  the header ask a problem that people may be having that your product has the potential\n","[26:48.400 --> 26:53.320]  to solve and then heading down into the features and benefits surrounding the product so I'm\n","[26:53.320 --> 26:57.940]  going to put a benefit as the header a short description going further into the description\n","[26:57.940 --> 27:01.640]  and then an image or gift that corresponds to the feature that I just listed and how\n","[27:01.640 --> 27:05.760]  I'm going to do that is first literally just deleting all of this that's already in here\n","[27:05.760 --> 27:09.840]  and I like to start off from scratch I'll come over here to heading one something like\n","[27:09.840 --> 27:14.080]  this protect yourself and your belongings everywhere you go this is probably one of\n","[27:14.080 --> 27:17.480]  the main reasons that somebody would buy this product in the first place and then after\n","[27:17.480 --> 27:21.240]  highlighting this main problem now I'm going to go ahead and introduce the solution and\n","[27:21.240 --> 27:25.400]  as you can see that's exactly what I did right here so I went from protecting yourself and\n","[27:25.400 --> 27:29.360]  your belongings everywhere you go our theft backpacks and bags are becoming a vital piece\n","[27:29.360 --> 27:34.480]  of gear for everyone who carries their gear to school work around town or when they travel\n","[27:34.480 --> 27:38.880]  hitting all different types of audiences of people this must have wearable backpack is\n","[27:38.880 --> 27:43.640]  designed to keep your gear safe and you looking stylish which is again the main problem that\n","[27:43.640 --> 27:47.600]  people are going to have now with the immediate solution then after this I'm just going to\n","[27:47.600 --> 27:51.660]  go ahead and add an interactive gift or image that's highlighting what I'm saying and how\n","[27:51.660 --> 27:57.080]  I do that is as simple as this so I'll just come over here to insert image upload file\n","[27:57.080 --> 28:00.600]  and then go ahead and select on the first image that I chose and now you see I have\n","[28:00.600 --> 28:05.080]  the problem the solution and the image that's highlighting all of that together and then\n","[28:05.080 --> 28:09.080]  I'll continue that same type of format for about four to five more features and benefits\n","[28:09.080 --> 28:18.560]  and then we'll have our product page built so let me go ahead and do that real quick\n","[28:18.560 --> 28:21.640]  and then when you're finished it should look something just like this so you see how it's\n","[28:21.640 --> 28:28.520]  the main feature the main benefit image main feature main benefit image all the way down\n","[28:28.520 --> 28:31.440]  and then whenever you're done you just go ahead and click on save now that you have\n","[28:31.440 --> 28:35.620]  all this saved you can actually preview it by clicking on this preview button right here\n","[28:35.620 --> 28:39.180]  and this gives you a rundown of what your product page basically looks like out the\n","[28:39.180 --> 28:44.000]  gate now one thing I definitely advise doing is having a compare price on your product\n","[28:44.000 --> 28:48.380]  page so you see how this just says $94.99 we want to make sure that they're actually\n","[28:48.380 --> 28:52.420]  getting a good sale when they're buying the product and what I like doing is at least\n","[28:52.420 --> 28:58.700]  a 50% off deal so I'll take this $94.99 and I'll multiply it by two and that's gonna be\n","[28:58.700 --> 29:04.100]  $189.98 so once I'm back on the Shopify page I'm just gonna go ahead and highlight this\n","[29:04.100 --> 29:07.940]  variant in an open bulk editor and that's where I'm gonna go ahead and put that compare\n","[29:07.940 --> 29:13.520]  price of $189.98 and then go ahead and click on save and now you can see you have your\n","[29:13.520 --> 29:17.940]  selling price and your compare price right here now there are going to be some apps that\n","[29:17.940 --> 29:21.480]  you're going to want to make sure that you have on your store that can help you increase\n","[29:21.480 --> 29:25.620]  your average order value which means more money back in your pocket and also some apps\n","[29:25.620 --> 29:30.300]  that will make your customers purchase from you I broke all those apps down and how to\n","[29:30.300 --> 29:34.300]  set them up in this video right here so make sure you go ahead and check that out after\n","[29:34.300 --> 29:38.580]  you finish watching this video so now you have your product page set up which is where\n","[29:38.580 --> 29:42.580]  you will be directing traffic to from your ads and although it's very important it's\n","[29:42.580 --> 29:47.460]  not going to do anything for you if the rest of your store is completely empty this means\n","[29:47.460 --> 29:51.660]  it's time for you to set up your actual storefront and homepage so if customers actually decide\n","[29:51.660 --> 29:55.740]  to browse around on your site they don't run into blank pages or links that don't work\n","[29:55.740 --> 29:59.840]  which can be detrimental to whether you're getting sales or not so as of right now if\n","[29:59.880 --> 30:04.240]  we do click on the homepage of our store you can see right now this is completely empty\n","[30:04.240 --> 30:08.780]  so with that being said we need to choose a theme and start building a theme is what\n","[30:08.780 --> 30:13.240]  allows you to control the layout of your store and how it looks and Shopify provides multiple\n","[30:13.240 --> 30:16.960]  free options that you can choose from if you want to see those options all you have to\n","[30:16.960 --> 30:21.280]  do is come over here to online store come down here to theme library go to explore free\n","[30:21.280 --> 30:26.120]  themes and you can see all the ones that Shopify offers right away now although there are paid\n","[30:26.120 --> 30:30.840]  or coded themes that you could use I think the free option is the best to use as a beginner\n","[30:30.840 --> 30:36.360]  as it won't slow the speed of your store down and they're very beginner friendly so let's\n","[30:36.360 --> 30:39.920]  take this refresh theme as an example we'll go ahead and click on that and then add to\n","[30:39.920 --> 30:44.000]  theme library and then once that's happening it will say right here installing theme and\n","[30:44.000 --> 30:46.440]  then you want to go ahead and publish that to your store so you'll come over here to\n","[30:46.440 --> 30:50.800]  actions and then go ahead and click on publish and then click on publish again and now you'll\n","[30:50.800 --> 30:54.320]  see that refresh theme is the actual theme published to your store we'll go ahead and\n","[30:54.320 --> 30:58.120]  scroll over here to customize right next to the theme and it will take us into the\n","[30:58.120 --> 31:03.240]  homepage of our store that we're able to customize it exactly how we want when building your\n","[31:03.240 --> 31:07.920]  store homepage you always want to make sure that it's as open and inviting as possible\n","[31:07.920 --> 31:12.960]  and possibly aiming towards whatever holiday or season is currently happening like right\n","[31:12.960 --> 31:17.160]  now since it's the winter time maybe I could have people outside playing in the snow or\n","[31:17.160 --> 31:20.760]  hanging around their family since that's what people are doing in the family time and making\n","[31:20.760 --> 31:24.900]  my store completely around them and I typically put this in my home image with the colors\n","[31:24.900 --> 31:28.920]  of my store matching whatever season is currently happening now like I said you want to keep\n","[31:28.920 --> 31:32.720]  these images general and this is going to be a key thing that you do especially when\n","[31:32.720 --> 31:37.500]  starting your dropshipping store as you always should start off with a general store a general\n","[31:37.500 --> 31:41.900]  store is a store that allows you to sell different products that may fall under different niches\n","[31:41.900 --> 31:46.040]  all under one specific store and I always suggest starting off with a general store\n","[31:46.040 --> 31:49.860]  because this is what's going to allow you to test out different products without having\n","[31:49.860 --> 31:53.940]  to change everything on your store every time just one of these things don't work out\n","[31:53.940 --> 31:58.100]  for you this then saves you time and money that you would be spending opening and building\n","[31:58.100 --> 32:02.800]  new Shopify stores every time you just want to test out a different product this is exactly\n","[32:02.800 --> 32:07.120]  why you want to keep your homepage as open and generic as possible more so pertaining\n","[32:07.120 --> 32:11.400]  to the season or holiday that is happening as opposed to putting a product on display\n","[32:11.400 --> 32:15.100]  that might not be the same product that you're selling next month and one of my favorite\n","[32:15.100 --> 32:19.700]  ways of finding these images that I know are non copyrighted is using one of my favorite\n","[32:19.700 --> 32:24.260]  free websites called pixels so you just come over here and type in pixel and it's going\n","[32:24.260 --> 32:28.020]  to be this one right here so because it's the winter time I want to keep it generic\n","[32:28.020 --> 32:32.140]  I'll probably just type in winter family and I mean this is a pretty good image right here\n","[32:32.140 --> 32:35.860]  and I can just go ahead and click on download and now I can come back to my store and add\n","[32:35.860 --> 32:43.920]  that image right away and I'm gonna go ahead and upload that real quick and this is what\n","[32:43.920 --> 32:47.340]  it looks like when you upload your first image I'm gonna go ahead and upload the rest of\n","[32:47.340 --> 32:54.340]  this product description and just like that in less than five minutes we have our homepage\n","[32:54.340 --> 32:58.900]  set up and ready to go and you can see I have winter so at the top around the season that's\n","[32:58.900 --> 33:04.420]  happening I have my background non copyrighted image all the way down to my mission statement\n","[33:04.420 --> 33:10.540]  some collections my main feature product even a email collector but at this point you're\n","[33:10.540 --> 33:15.360]  missing one thing which is your logo since we have a general store with a general store\n","[33:15.360 --> 33:20.560]  name you got that right we're going to make our logo kind of general and there's no reason\n","[33:20.560 --> 33:24.400]  to spend hundreds of dollars on getting a logo made when you can head over to canva\n","[33:24.400 --> 33:28.420]  and make one in less than five minutes with the templates that we have waiting for you\n","[33:28.420 --> 33:32.680]  so just come over here type in canva.com and then you want to come over here to the search\n","[33:32.680 --> 33:36.560]  bar and type in logo and you're gonna see all the different logos that you can work\n","[33:36.560 --> 33:40.960]  with I like to just choose a logo that sticks out to me and then just throw my brand name\n","[33:40.960 --> 33:44.760]  in there and then choose the colors that I want my store to be I always suggest that\n","[33:44.800 --> 33:49.360]  when you're building your logo you just choose white black and one accent color so it's not\n","[33:49.360 --> 33:53.760]  too busy and distracting from your store you want a nice clean and professional feel and\n","[33:53.760 --> 33:57.360]  that's exactly what that's going to do for you so I could choose this one right here\n","[33:57.360 --> 34:06.080]  for example now I can go ahead and build this logo out real quickly and I mean it's literally\n","[34:06.080 --> 34:09.520]  this easy once I'm done with that I'm gonna come over here to share and then I'm gonna\n","[34:09.520 --> 34:13.040]  go ahead and download it and you do want to download it with the transparent background\n","[34:13.040 --> 34:16.720]
